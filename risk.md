our business is launching with new concept in clothing trends but, it has to face some of the risks which are as following: -

\**Financial:** To start our brand or start working in the fashion industry we definitely need an initial budget. It is much harder to maintain finances to initiate a business. If our business strategies and mission will not attract our financial supporters as we are launching our product as late followers with some modifications in clothing trends according to the culture of different people and country. Due to these reasons maybe our financial supporters refuse to invest in our business.

As well as if the customers will not like and attract towards our product concept then they will not buy our products there will be a great loss in our business, however if our product enamour the customers and if we would have an order exceeded our ability to make the products and we failed to do it then we will lose customers’ loyalty consequently we will be in loss as a result we will not able to maintain our profit and loss portfolio then financers will do backout from our business.

\**Competitors:** As we will enter the market as a latecomers due to which we have a low knowledge about the market and not have much market reputation as well global presence than already existing competitors. However, our brand will launch with some additional concepts in market-related to custom and culture but, people are attracted more towards western culture due to which they might not be influence towards our products, in addition to this, we don’t have such good relationship with customers which will also be a risk in future to promote our products in market.

\**Trends Analysis:** Another risk to our clothing store business is trend assessment. Trends in fashion industry are fickle and nature of fashion industry is unpredictable and has short life span and needs to refresh its products in a timely manner but as we will make outfits related to different cultures and the culture never change so our products might be rejected by people that’s why one misstep may result in excessive inventory and confused brand identity for the store. All of these mistakes may prove fatal in our clothing brand.

\**Team:** To start any business the team members should have skills regarding their working field including passion and self-motivation towards their work. So, it will be hard to find whole skilled employees for our business with professional certification. However, if we have skilled team members but they will not able to maintain their relationship with customers by behaving rude with customers and they will not able to fulfil the demands according to customers’ requirement then we will have to face problems in our business.

\**Suppliers:** A business is fully dependent on suppliers as for the manufacture of our products we will need raw materials which will be imported from other regions but, if our suppliers will not able to supply it due to some delays which increase the lead time and in such situations the risk of both obsolescence and markdown is high as well as the significant inventory carrying cost that certainty is incurred somewhere in supply chain as a result of the lengthy pipeline.
